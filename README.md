- 👀 I’m interested in project management, data analysis, technical writing & documentation, and cats. Oh, and tea! 
- 🌱 I work in HTML & CSS currently, and also have some R and JavaScript experience but am learning other XMLs etc. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on technical documentation for git projects - if you need documentation, let me know!
