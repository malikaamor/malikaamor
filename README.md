- 👋 Hi, I’m @malikaamor
- 👀 I’m interested in technical writing & documentation, project management, and cats. Oh, and tea! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning project management best practices and technical documentation - I work in HTML & CSS currently, but am learning other XMLs etc. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on technical documentation for git projects - if you need documentation, let me know! 
- 📫 How to reach me - malika.amoruso@gmail.com
